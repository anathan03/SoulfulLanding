I want to build a high-converting, soulful landing page website for my digital product — a Nurse Life Bundle — designed for nurses who feel burnt out, overwhelmed, or are prepping for the NCLEX.

The site should follow Alex Hormozi’s core marketing principles:
- Clear Value > Price messaging
- Low friction layout and navigation
- Emotionally resonant story and offer
- High-contrast call-to-action
- Trust-building refund policy and urgency
- Optimized layout for mobile and desktop

**Website Style**: Soulful, nurturing, calm — use soft blues, lavender, and pastel accents. Rounded edges, clean sans-serif fonts, and sectioned layout for clarity.

**Page Structure (Single Page with Sticky Nav)**:
1. **Hero Section**: 
   - Powerful headline: “From Burnout to Balance — The Ultimate Nurse Life Bundle”
   - Subheadline: “A soulful self-care + study system for new, busy, or burned-out nurses.”
   - CTA button: “Get the Bundle for $6 on Etsy”
   - Link to: https://studyflowco.etsy.com
   - Include a soft gradient background, illustration/icon of a nurse, and trust note: “Refund guaranteed if not satisfied.”

2. **What’s Inside Section**: 
   - Display cards for each of the 5 components with icons or images:
     - 90-Day Soulful Gratitude Journal (PDF)
     - Burnout Recovery Journal (PDF)
     - Free Mindfulness Exercises (Bonus PDF)
     - Study Flashcards (Quizlet: Labs, Acid-Base, Pharm)
     - Self-Care Shift Planner (Google Sheets)
   - Optional button: “See it in action on Etsy”

3. **Why This Helps**: 
   - Brief paragraph: “Created by someone who works alongside nurses daily, this bundle brings peace, structure, and clarity into their hectic days.”
   - Bullet points:
     - 🧠 Stress less with easy-to-follow self-care
     - 📋 Prep smarter with high-yield NCLEX notes
     - 📅 Stay organized with shift and budget planners

4. **Urgency Callout**:
   - Box or banner: “Only 15 bundles available — grab yours before they’re gone.”

5. **Guarantee Section**:
   - Soft blockquote style: “If it doesn’t help you feel calmer or more organized, get a full refund. No questions asked.”

6. **Email Opt-In Pop-Up**:
   - Pop-up triggered after 10 seconds OR when user scrolls past 50%
   - Message: “Want a free nurse self-care tracker? Enter your email to download it instantly.”
   - Save email to a placeholder form or mock integration

7. **Footer**:
   - Simple footer with links: About, Contact, Refund Policy, Privacy, Disclaimer
   - Include lightweight analytics script to simulate click and page tracking

**Technical Features**:
- All files: index.html, style.css, scripts.js
- Add responsive design for mobile
- Include placeholder code for email collection form + analytics
- All links point to https://studyflowco.etsy.com
